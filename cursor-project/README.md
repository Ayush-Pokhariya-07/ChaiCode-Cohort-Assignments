# Cursor Landing Page Clone

A pixel-perfect recreation of the [Cursor.com](https://cursor.com) landing page, built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**.

This project was built as an assignment for the **Chai Code Web Dev Cohort**. The goal was to master modern CSS layout techniques, specifically **CSS Grid** (Bento Grids) and **Flexbox**, while maintaining a high-quality "Dark Mode" aesthetic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure (header, nav, section, footer).
- **CSS3**: Custom properties (variables), Flexbox, CSS Grid, Media Queries.
- **Fonts**: Inter (via Google Fonts).

## ✨ Key Features

- **Bento Grid Layout**: Recreated the complex "dashboard" style grid used on the original site.
- **Pixel-Perfect Dark Mode**: used specific warm-black tones (`#14120b`) to match the original brand identity.
- **Responsive Design**: The grid adjusts for smaller screens.
- **Glow Effects**: Custom CSS shadows and gradients to mimic the "AI" feel.
- **No Frameworks**: Built completely from scratch without Bootstrap or Tailwind.

## What I Learned

- How to structure a complex landing page using semantic HTML.
- Mastering `display: grid` and `grid-column: span` to create irregular layouts.
- Using CSS variables for consistent color theming.
- Handling positioning (absolute/relative) for decorative elements like the "fake code window" dots.
